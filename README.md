Task 1: Basic Excel Skills
As a foundational tool in the banking and finance industry, mastering Microsoft Excel is essential for roles in accounting, corporate finance, commercial banking, or investment banking. Your first task as a new graduate at the firm is to complete several worked examples designed to teach the basics of Excel, particularly how it applies to finance. These exercises will cover:

Cell Basics: Alignment, cell and text manipulation, column and row operations, formats, dates, formulas, copying, pasting, and transposing data.
Formatting: Numbers, borders, column and row alignment, and converting text to columns.
Comments: How to add and remove them.
Naming: Utilizing the name manager and applying names in formulas.
Setting Up a New Sheet: Includes header setup, font selection and sizing, and adjusting column/row sizes.
Task 2: Forecasting Operating Assumptions
Your firm has been asked to assist a cupcake shop with forecasting its 5-year business plan. Using the information provided, your task is to complete an Excel template to build out operating assumptions related to Revenue, Costs, Cash Flow, and Other metrics. This exercise is designed to reinforce the Excel skills you learned in Task 1.

Task 3: Translating Assumptions to the P&L
With the forecast assumptions completed, your next step is to create a Profit & Loss (P&L) statement. This statement will show the company’s profits or losses over a specified period (typically a financial year). Your task is to populate the provided P&L template, incorporating key metrics such as revenue growth and margin percentages, based on the order and structure of the assumptions sheet.

Task 4: Forecasting Cash Flows
To determine if the cupcake shop can execute its 5-year plan, you will need to forecast the company’s cash flows. This includes calculating net cash flows for each year and determining how much of the excess cash can be used to pay down debt. You will use the cash flow assumptions and the P&L tab to complete the cash flow forecast. Additionally, you must link the "Net Interest" line in the P&L to the corresponding values in the Cash Flow tab.

Task 5: Creating Outputs in Excel
Finally, you'll summarize the forecasted financial data into client-ready charts. Your senior has requested the following visualizations:

A Column Chart showing Revenue from 2020-2024.
A Line Chart displaying Closing Debt from 2020-2024.
An Area Chart showing Closing Cash from 2020-2024, with a data point label only for 2024.
A Combination Chart featuring Cupcake Units Sold (columns) and Average Sale Price (line) from 2020-2024.
Pay close attention to formatting guidelines, including font size, font color, chart colors, labels, number formats, and line formatting, ensuring that your charts meet the client’s standards.
